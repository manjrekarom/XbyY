# XbyY
### How to make, build, solve X with Y?

I have been programming (professionally) for around a year now. I think I can say I am a little more experienced than a neophyte developer. 

One of the problems I see myself and most like me struggling with is, how to solve a particular problem without reinventing the wheel. While reinventing the wheel should not be a problem for a beginner because that is how we will learn the crux or important parts of it, but the method that we use before sticks with us for long. 

Instead if I could just know about the things that are out there with which we can do it easily (after taking the hard route once or twice), I think that would be great.

You would argue that you can easily do a google search. Yes we can, but a lot of times its difficult to search something because we don't really know what we want and if a tool or a library for it already exists.


### What could the problems(Xs) be?
#### 1. General software development
  I was working on a big (for me) Java project for the first time, on my own. I didn't know how to check if my code is proper without linking it to the main. Little did I know about unit tests back then. 

#### 2. Web and mobile apps
  Tools to create good boilerplate code for certain web frameworks, libraries that help with login, form validation, etc. Libraries for UI scroll features, nav bars, dialog boxes, etc.

#### 3. Cool things that you can do with certain libraries very easily

#### 4. Code snippets

#### 5. Issues that you think cannot be typed in the search bar because its very verbose to explain



This repository will be collection of such and other recurring issues that can be easily solved with libraries and frameworks already out there (solution need not necessarily be a library or a framework).

Let's build a database of problems that we face generally, frustrate ourselves with :P and later find a better way to do it.

Also, its hacktoberfest time.


### What is Hacktoberfest?
A month-long celebration from October 1st - 31st sponsored by [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2433-celebrate-open-source-this-october-with-hacktoberfest) to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open source developer community.

[https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)


### What you have to do or rather how to contribute?
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your forked repository. 
3. Modify the [XbyY.md](./XbyY.md) file and add a new file in [XbyY folder](https://github.com/manjrekarom/XbyY/tree/master/XbyY).
4. Make any additional changes (if you need to create new folder or files).
5. Push the changes to your local reposiory.
4. Make a PR for changes to be added here.
5. And lastly **Star this repository** if you think the idea is something that you find of use. Thanks!

### What to change and a template for changes?
You will directly edit the **XbyY.md file** with your name, problem and category. You will also create and upload a file in the **XbyY folder**. The problem statement will cover your problem. Give a brief solution (preferrably one-two words, if its some code snippet write the language name like in Python) like name of the library or framework or practise.

**The problem statement will be a link to the file you make in XbyY folder. This file will contain the complete solution.**

Next, mention the problem category like web apps, mobile apps, ML, etc. This will work like an index.

Now, in the XbyY folder, create a Markdown file with a name resembling your problem statement (or anything but keep it short, simple and understandable). Explain your solution with name of the library and link to it. Don't make it too big unless very necessary. Most of the times, just knowing such a library or a practise exists, the user will be able to learn more about it on their own. If its a big library or framework please link specific parts of it. Also, give tutorial links from the internet or other resources which could be helpful. 

If your solution is not hosted as a tutorial anywhere on the internet, that is, if its a custom one like code snippet or something you can create a code file and tutorial file for it in the folder for code snippets (or some folder that resembles your problem statement) and include the folder in the commit. **Create your folder (with name resembling problem statement) inside XbyYTutorial folder.** After that give a link to that specific folder or file in tutorial.

Make this change in the [XbyY.md](./XbyY.md)
